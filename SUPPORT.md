- File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
- Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.
- The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.
- Observe the inline guidelines of the Issue template.
